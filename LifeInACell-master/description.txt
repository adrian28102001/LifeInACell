Short description for our project:
1. We have 2 types of cells : Thieves and Police
2. We added some rules for them: 
	a) If Thief is near Police, then Police will catch him and wiil go to it's position.
	b) If a Policeman is between 4 thieves, they will beat him and Policeman will dissapear.
3. We added some environments:
	a) Prison - is an environment that kills all type of cells that are instantiating on it, 
prisoners because they get inprisoned and police also do, since the prison is full of dangerous criminals
	c) Regeneration - is an environment where the reproduction is working faster.
4. Every object that appears in our game is instantiated randomly.
5. We added an option to increase or decrease the generatiion interval by pressing Up Arrow or Down Arrow key and also you can see total number of each type of animal.
